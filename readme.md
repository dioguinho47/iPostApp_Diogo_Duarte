Welcome to my iPost Application! MM207 Applikasjonsutvikling Exam

The purpose of this application is to share messages with other users throughout posts and reactions :)

Basic understanding of how to get started:

1. Create a user
2. Log in with the created user
3. Create a post and share it!

How to start project:

npm start or node server.js

Note:

To test the application locally, delete "ssl: {rejectUnauthorized: false}" from database.js, and remove
"node_modules" from the .gitignore file to allow the folder to be used locally. Once thatÂ´s done use
npm start or node server.js

The app is also hosted on heroku: https://ipostapplication.herokuapp.com/
